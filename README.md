# NGXS + Angular

This is an Angular + NGXS (State Management) application representing a (not so good looking) Todo List app.
It has very basic operations such as create a todo, edit a todo and delete a todo. Each of those operations communicate via the NGXS state management.

Angular: [Angular](https://angular.dev/).

NGXS: [NGXS](https://www.ngxs.io/).

## Build

After running `npm install`:
